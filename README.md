# Vue Interface

This is a monorepo for the components of [Vue Interface](https://github.com/vue-interface). Each component is its own independent repository, and becomes a workspaces and Git submodule inside this monorepo. The purpose of this monorepo is provide a convenient and efficient way to develop UI components that are dependent on each other without relying on symlinks and other hacks that provide less than optimal development experiences.

## Installation

We prefer `pnpm`, but you can use `npm` or `yarn` to install too. 

```bash
pnpm i vue-interface
```

## Basic Usage

The monorepo will import all the Vue Interface packages. Vue Interface has full ESM and Typescript support, with tree shaking. Only the components you actually use will end up in your bundle.

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { InputField } from 'vue-interface';

const app = createApp({
    components: {
        InputField
    }
});

app.mount('#app');
```

## Developing

To start developing in the mono repo run the following commands. `pnpm install` should be ran the first time, after anything package.json updates or when adding another submodule.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Versioning

Each package is independently versioned using strict [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The monorepo should import the packages with the stable versions. If a package introduces a breaking change, a major version should be made on the monorepo. The versions of the monorepo and packages are independent.

```bash
pnpm version
pnpm version --filter=@vue-interface/input-field
pnpm version --filter=@vue-interface/input-field...
pnpm version --filter=@vue-interface/input-field^...
```

## Publishing

The monorepo makes it easy to publish changes into NPM. Ensure the following exists in the workspace in `.github/workflows/build.yaml` and Github actions will do the rest. Any commit with a version tag (for example `v1.0.0`) will be published in NPM. The `dist` should be ignored.

```yaml
name: Build
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
